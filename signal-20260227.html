<p>This is the signal that matters most this week. January PPI came in scorching hot: headline +0.5% month-on-month against a 0.3% consensus, with core PPI at +0.8% — the highest monthly reading in six months and nearly triple the 0.3% expectation. Year-on-year core producer prices accelerated to 3.6%, well above the 3.0% forecast. Services prices rose 0.8%, led by a 14.4% jump in professional and commercial equipment wholesaling margins. There was visible tariff pass-through in apparel, chemicals, and telecommunications.</p>

<p>In any normal cycle, this print would be dollar-positive. Higher inflation means higher-for-longer rates, which means yield advantage, which means dollar bid. Instead, DXY fell 0.19% to 97.60. The session high of 97.85 was printed in the immediate aftermath of the 8:30 release and sold within minutes. The dollar closed near its session low.</p>

<p>This is the third time in February that hot macro data has failed to produce sustained dollar strength. Core CPI surprised higher on February 12. PPI surprised higher today. Both times, the dollar rallied for minutes, then reversed. The market is telling you something: when inflation is coming from tariffs rather than demand, it's not dollar-positive — it's growth-negative. The Fed can't hike into tariff-driven supply shocks, and the market knows it. Money markets are now pricing the first cut for July with reduced probability, but crucially, they're not pricing hikes. The dollar is stuck.</p>

<p>Gold read the PPI perfectly. XAU/USD surged from 5,167 to 5,258 intraday before settling at 5,248 — up 1.18% and the strongest close since late January. The session was broad-based demand: central banks continue accumulating, the Iran risk premium is rising with the USS Gerald Ford now deployed to the eastern Mediterranean, and the inflation print reinforced the structural case that real rates will decline as the Fed eventually cuts into persistent above-target inflation. Gold is 6.2% below its January 28 all-time high of 5,595 and building a base for the next leg.</p>

<p>On Iran: Geneva Round 3 ended without a deal. Iran rejected demands to halt enrichment, dismantle Fordow/Natanz/Isfahan, and ship its 10,000kg uranium stockpile abroad. Both sides described the talks as "the most intense" yet. Oman's FM called it "significant progress" and technical talks will continue in Vienna next week at IAEA headquarters. Trump said he's "not happy" with progress. Secretary Rubio travels to Israel March 2-3. The military option is still on the table — and with two carrier groups within striking distance, the market cannot ignore it. Brent crude closed at $72.73, up 2.2%, reflecting the rising risk premium.</p>

<p>Equities had a rough session. The S&P 500 fell 0.8% to 6,908, now negative for 2026. The Nasdaq dropped 0.93% as the post-Nvidia earnings hangover continued — NVDA fell another 5% despite beating estimates, as investors questioned AI sustainability. The VIX spiked 14% to 21.35, its highest since November. Risk-off is accelerating and that's supportive of the gold trade.</p>

<p>Week in review: DXY dipped to a low of 97.36 on Monday after the SCOTUS tariff ruling, rallied to 98.00 on Tuesday (SOTU), tested 98.00 again Wednesday, and has now faded to 97.60. Four tests of 98.00, four failures to hold. The week closes with the dollar down 0.19% from Friday's prior close, but the price action tells a bearish story: the ceiling is confirmed, the PPI couldn't sustain a bid, and gold is back above 5,200.</p>

<div class="thesis-box">
  <div class="thesis-label"><span class="dot"></span> Q2 Thesis Status: Strengthening</div>
  <div class="thesis-text">Structurally bearish USD, long gold, long EUR on dips. Today was the thesis confirmation day: the hottest core PPI in six months failed to produce a sustained dollar bid. The market has separated tariff-driven inflation from demand-driven inflation and is pricing the former as growth-negative. Gold surging on the same day as hot inflation + Iran escalation + equity selloff is the structural bid at work. The 98.00 ceiling is confirmed. March PCE (March 13) and the FOMC meeting (March 17-18) are the next major tests.</div>

<div class="keywatch-box">
  <div class="keywatch-label">Key Watch</div>
  <div class="keywatch-text"><strong>The PPI confirmed the thesis.</strong> Tariff-driven inflation is not generating dollar strength. The market has internalized this. The next test is March 13 PCE — if the hot PPI components (healthcare, portfolio management) feed through into core PCE above 2.8% year-on-year, the Fed is trapped: too-high inflation to cut, too-fragile growth to hike. That's the goldilocks environment for gold and the structural dollar bear case. Meanwhile, Iran remains the wildcard — Rubio in Israel next week with carrier groups deployed means the military option is live. Any strike would send gold through 5,500 and oil through $80.</div>
